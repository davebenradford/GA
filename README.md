# Repository for Master's Thesis

These files are related to my Master's Thesis project at the University of Guelph in Ontario.

The goal of this thesis is to determine if a Genetic Algorithm can be implemented successfully for a parallel computing architecture (CUDA) using parallel patterns to achieve signficant improvements in speedup and efficiency compared to the serial implementation.
